# Fake Commit Graphs

### This project is only to show that github contribution graph don't really matter. It's just the work you put up what matters.

Basically creates a fake contribution graph on your github overview page.


Usage:

1. Clone repo.

## Warning:
```diff
Running the script will directly edit your contribution graph, you have to delete the repo in your github account to reverse contribution graph changes.
```
2. Run the python script using the command:

```
python generate_graph.py
```

3. Let it do the job.
